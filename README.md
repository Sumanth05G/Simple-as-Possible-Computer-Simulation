# Simple-as-Possible-Computer-Simulation
CircuitVerse Simulation of a very simple processor with 16 byte program memory, and all components designed from gate level.
Report.pdf have more information about the circuit.

## Usage
1. Download the `SAP-Computer.cv` file.
2. Go to [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/).
3. Import the cv file to view and interact with the simulation.
4. Report.pdf have some sample programs and their corresponding data to be loaded in RAM for simulation.
